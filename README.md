# Global Seismic Activity Monitor

## Description

The Global Seismic Activity Monitor is a React-based web application that visualizes real-time and historical global earthquake data on an interactive 3D globe. It provides detailed statistics, insights into seismic events, and educational information about earthquake science. Users can explore recent and significant earthquakes, view their details, and understand their distribution and magnitude in a geographical context.

## Features

* Interactive 3D Globe: Visualizes earthquake epicenters on a zoomable, rotatable globe.
* Real-time & Historical Data: Fetches and displays earthquake data from USGS for various periods (last hour, day, week, month).
* Geographical Layers: Shows tectonic plate boundaries and coastlines for geological context.
* Latest Major Quake Highlight: Visual highlight (pulsing ring on the globe) and textual banner/timer indicating the most recent significant earthquake (M4.5+).
* Detailed Earthquake View: Modal display providing comprehensive information for selected earthquakes, including magnitude, depth, location, fault plane solutions (beachball diagrams), ShakeMap/PAGER alerts, moment tensor solutions (Mww), seismic wave data, and energy estimations when available.
    * **2D Regional Map**: Displays the earthquake's epicenter, ShakeMap intensity (if available), and tectonic plates on a 2D map within the detail view for regional context.
* Smart Globe Rotation: Globe auto-rotates and intelligently pauses when the user hovers over the sphere, resuming on mouse-out.
* Dynamic Statistics & Charts:
    * Overview panel with key statistics for the last 24 hours.
    * Summaries for different timeframes (last hour, 24h, 7-day, 14-day, 30-day).
    * Paginated and sortable earthquake list/table.
    * Magnitude distribution charts.
    * Earthquake frequency timelines.
    * Magnitude vs. Depth scatter plots.
    * Regional distribution lists.
* Earthquake Cluster Analysis: Identifies and displays details for clusters of seismic events, including a mini-map and summary statistics for the cluster.
* Featured Quakes: Highlights notable recent or historical earthquakes.
* Educational Snippets: Provides brief explanations on earthquake concepts like magnitude, depth, and intensity.
* Dedicated 'Learn' Page: Provides educational content and detailed explanations about earthquake science and terminology.
* **Regional Faulting Display**: Incorporates and displays data on regional fault lines, enhancing geological context and understanding. This feature was added as part of the vibe process using the Claude code CLI.
* Responsive Sidebar: Dynamically loads and displays detailed analysis panels.

## Data Source

* Earthquake data is sourced from the **U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake Hazards Program** via their GeoJSON feeds.

## Technologies Used

* **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **React Globe GL**: For 3D globe visualization using ThreeJS/WebGL.
* **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
* **Vite**: Frontend build tool.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **Cloudflare Workers**: For hosting, deployment, and serverless backend functions.

## Deployment

The application is deployed as a **Cloudflare Worker**, which handles both the serving of the static frontend assets (built with **Vite**) and the backend serverless functions.

*   **Unified Deployment**: The React-based user interface and the serverless backend logic (e.g., USGS proxy, API endpoints) are managed and deployed as a single Cloudflare Worker.
*   **Static Asset Serving**: The Worker script is configured to serve the static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) generated by the Vite build process. This is typically managed via an `ASSETS` binding in the `wrangler.toml` configuration.
*   **Serverless Functions**: API endpoints, data proxying, and other backend tasks are handled by the same Worker script.
*   **Configuration**: Worker configuration, including routes, environment variables, KV/D1 bindings, and build steps for the worker itself, is managed through the `wrangler.toml` file.

This project utilizes distinct environments for development, staging, and production, managed through **Cloudflare Workers** and **Wrangler**.

*   **`production`**: This is the live environment that serves the application to end-users. It uses production-ready configurations, including the main D1 database and KV namespaces.
*   **`staging`**: This environment is intended for pre-production testing. It mirrors the production setup and, importantly, **uses the same production D1 database and KV namespace bindings**. This allows for testing with live data to ensure changes are safe and performant before they are deployed to the live `production` environment. Use this environment with caution due to its use of live data.
*   **`preview`**: Preview deployments are automatically generated for each commit pushed to a branch (other than the production branch). These are deployed as **Cloudflare Workers**, often orchestrated via a CI/CD pipeline (which might be integrated with **Cloudflare Pages** for build and preview URL generation, e.g., `*.pages.dev`). These environments use preview-specific D1 and KV namespaces, suitable for testing new features in isolation without affecting production or staging data.
*   **`dev`**: This refers to the local development environment. For the frontend, **Vite** (usually via `npm run dev`) is used. For testing the Worker functions locally, `wrangler dev` is the command. This setup typically uses preview or development-specific bindings defined in `wrangler.toml` to avoid impacting live data.

Manual deployments to specific environments can be performed using npm or yarn scripts defined in `package.json`.

*   **Deploying to Staging**:
    ```bash
    npm run deploy:staging
    ```
*   **Deploying to Production**:
    ```bash
    npm run deploy:production
    ```
The `production` environment is connected to the main branch of the Git repository, and deployments to production occur automatically when changes are merged into that branch. The `staging` environment might also be configured for automatic deployments from a specific branch (e.g., `develop` or `staging`), or manual deployments can be used as part of the release process. Preview deployments are typically automated, potentially using **Cloudflare Pages'** CI/CD capabilities for the build and deployment pipeline.

## Development

This Global Seismic Activity Monitor was brought to life through a dynamic and iterative development process. The project was conceptualized and significantly shaped within Gemini Canvas, leveraging a conversational AI-assisted development workflow.

This project serves as an ongoing testbed for advanced Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities in real-world software engineering. AI agents frequently drive development, maintenance, and iterative enhancements. This process includes rigorously testing the LLM's ability to:
* Understand complex requirements.
* Generate and refactor code.
* Debug issues.
* Contribute to documentation.

This ongoing collaboration aims to push the boundaries of what LLMs can achieve in practical, non-trivial application development, providing valuable insights into their strengths and areas for continued improvement. The Global Seismic Activity Monitor is therefore not just a tool for visualizing earthquakes, but also a living experiment in the evolving landscape of AI-assisted software creation.

The project reflects the spirit of innovation and agile creation championed by **Built By Vibes**.

## Project Structure

The `src/` directory contains the core source code for the application, organized as follows:

-   **`assets/`**: Static assets like images, JSON data files (e.g., `TectonicPlateBoundaries.json`, `ne_110m_coastline.json`).
-   **`components/`**: Core UI components. Most components are directly within this folder.
    -   **`components/earthquakeDetail/`**: Components specifically used within the `EarthquakeDetailView`.
    -   **`components/skeletons/`**: Skeleton loader components used for placeholder UI during data fetching.
-   **`constants/`**: Application-wide constants, primarily in `appConstants.js` (e.g., API URLs, thresholds).
-   **`contexts/`**: React Context providers and custom hooks for global state management (e.g., `EarthquakeDataContext.jsx`, `UIStateContext.jsx`).
-   **`functions/`**: Houses serverless function logic, primarily API handlers and related tests, integral to the Cloudflare Worker's operation (e.g., `functions/api/calculate-clusters.js`). The main Worker entry point, `src/worker.js`, orchestrates routing to these functions and other frontend asset-serving logic.
    -   **`functions/api/`**: Contains API route handlers (e.g., for cluster calculations, D1 database interactions).
-   **`features/`**: Intended for feature-specific modules in future development (currently contains a `.gitkeep` file).
-   **`hooks/`**: Intended for custom React hooks (currently contains a `.gitkeep` file).
-   **`pages/`**: Top-level React components representing different application pages/views (e.g., `HomePage.jsx`, which defines the main application structure and routes).
    -   **`pages/learn/`**: Components for specific educational article pages.
-   **`services/`**: Modules for interacting with external APIs or backend services (e.g., `usgsApiService.js`, `clusterApiService.js`).
-   **`utils/`**: General utility functions used across the application (e.g., `utils.js`, `clusterUtils.js`).
-   **`main.jsx`**: The main entry point for the React application, rendering the root component from `HomePage.jsx`.
-   **`index.css`**: Global styles and Tailwind CSS base configuration.

Additionally, at the project root:

-   **`wrangler.toml`**: The configuration file for Cloudflare Workers projects. It defines build settings, environments, routes, service bindings (like KV, D1, and static assets), cron triggers, and compatibility settings for the Worker.

This structure promotes a logical organization of the codebase, simplifying navigation and maintenance. JSDoc comments are used extensively throughout `.jsx` files to document components, functions, props, and data structures, further aiding in code comprehension.

## Technical Documentation

The codebase includes comprehensive JSDoc comments within the `.jsx` files in the `src` directory. These comments explain components, functions, props, and data structures to facilitate easier understanding and maintenance.

### Generating HTML Documentation

You can generate HTML documentation from these JSDoc comments using the `jsdoc` npm package.

1.  **Install JSDoc and a template (e.g., Docdash)**:
    You can install `jsdoc` globally or as a development dependency in your project. `docdash` is a popular clean template.
    ```bash
    # Global installation
    npm install -g jsdoc docdash

    # Or, as dev dependencies
    npm install --save-dev jsdoc docdash
    ```

2.  **Create a JSDoc Configuration File (Optional but Recommended)**:
    Create a `jsdoc.json` (or `conf.json`) file in your project root for better control over the documentation generation process.
    Example `jsdoc.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "source": {
        "include": ["src"],
        "includePattern": ".+\\.jsx?$",
        "excludePattern": "(node_modules|docs)"
      },
      "opts": {
        "destination": "./docs/jsdoc/",
        "recurse": true,
        "readme": "./README.md",
        "template": "node_modules/docdash"
      },
      "plugins": ["plugins/markdown"],
      "templates": {
        "default": {
          "outputSourceFiles": false
        },
        "docdash": {
          "static": true,
          "sort": true,
          "search": true,
          "collapse": true,
          "typedefs": true,
          "removeQuotes": "none",
          "menu": {
            "Github repo": {
              "href": "https://github.com/builtbyvibes/global-seismic-activity-monitor",
              "target": "_blank"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    *Note: The `template` path in `jsdoc.json` assumes `docdash` is installed locally (i.e., in `node_modules`). If you installed `docdash` globally, you may need to provide the absolute path to the global `docdash` template directory or configure JSDoc to find global templates.*

3.  **Run JSDoc**:
    Since `jsdoc` and `docdash` are listed as development dependencies in `package.json`, you can run JSDoc using `npx` after installing dependencies (`npm install`).

    If you are using the `jsdoc.json` configuration file (recommended):
    ```bash
    npx jsdoc -c jsdoc.json
    ```
    Alternatively, you can specify options directly on the command line:
    ```bash
    npx jsdoc src -r -d docs/jsdoc --template node_modules/docdash --readme README.md
    ```
    This will generate the documentation in the `docs/jsdoc/` directory. Open the `index.html` file in that directory to view the documentation.

    **Recommended:** For convenience, consider adding a script to your `package.json`:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      // ... other scripts
      "docs": "jsdoc -c jsdoc.json"
    }
    ```
    Then, you can simply run:
    ```bash
    npm run docs
    ```

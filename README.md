# Global Seismic Activity Monitor

## Description

The Global Seismic Activity Monitor is a React-based web application that visualizes real-time and historical global earthquake data on an interactive 3D globe. It provides detailed statistics, insights into seismic events, and educational information about earthquake science. Users can explore recent and significant earthquakes, view their details, and understand their distribution and magnitude in a geographical context.

## Features

* Interactive 3D Globe: Visualizes earthquake epicenters on a zoomable, rotatable globe.
* Real-time & Historical Data: Fetches and displays earthquake data from USGS for various periods (last hour, day, week, month).
* Geographical Layers: Shows tectonic plate boundaries and coastlines for geological context.
* Latest Major Quake Highlight: Visual highlight (pulsing ring on the globe) and textual banner/timer indicating the most recent significant earthquake (M4.5+).
* Detailed Earthquake View: Modal display providing comprehensive information for selected earthquakes, including magnitude, depth, location, fault plane solutions (beachball diagrams), ShakeMap/PAGER alerts, moment tensor solutions (Mww), seismic wave data, and energy estimations when available.
    * **2D Regional Map**: Within the detail view, a 2D map displays the earthquake's epicenter, ShakeMap intensity image (if available), and tectonic plate boundaries for regional context.
* Smart Globe Rotation: Globe auto-rotates and intelligently pauses when the user hovers over the sphere, resuming on mouse-out.
* Dynamic Statistics & Charts:
    * Overview panel with key statistics for the last 24 hours.
    * Summaries for different timeframes (last hour, 24h, 7-day, 14-day, 30-day).

    * Magnitude distribution charts.
    * Earthquake frequency timelines.
    * Magnitude vs. Depth scatter plots.
    * Regional distribution lists.
* Earthquake Cluster Analysis: Identifies and displays details for clusters of seismic events, including a mini-map and summary statistics for the cluster.
* Featured Quakes: Highlights notable recent or historical earthquakes.
* Educational Snippets: Provides brief explanations on earthquake concepts like magnitude, depth, and intensity.
* Dedicated 'Learn' Page: Provides educational content and detailed explanations about earthquake science and terminology.
* Responsive Sidebar: Dynamically loads and displays detailed analysis panels.

## Data Source

* Earthquake data is sourced from the **U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake Hazards Program** via their GeoJSON feeds.

## Technologies Used

* **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **React Globe GL**: For 3D globe visualization using ThreeJS/WebGL.
* **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
* **Vite**: Frontend build tool.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **Cloudflare Workers**: For hosting, deployment, and serverless backend functions.

## Deployment / Infrastructure

The application is deployed as a **Cloudflare Worker**, which handles both the serving of the static frontend assets (built with Vite) and the backend serverless functions.

*   **Unified Deployment**: The React-based user interface and the serverless backend logic (e.g., USGS proxy, API endpoints) are managed and deployed as a single Cloudflare Worker.
*   **Static Asset Serving**: The Worker script is configured to serve the static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) generated by the Vite build process. This is typically managed via an `ASSETS` binding in the `wrangler.toml` configuration.
*   **Serverless Functions**: API endpoints, data proxying, and other backend tasks are handled by the same Worker script.
*   **Configuration**: Worker configuration, including routes, environment variables, KV/D1 bindings, and build steps for the worker itself, is managed through the `wrangler.toml` file.
*   **Benefits**: This setup offers significant advantages, including:
    *   **Scalability**: Cloudflare Workers scale automatically to handle traffic load.
    *   **Performance**: Cloudflare's extensive Content Delivery Network (CDN) ensures that the application and its data are delivered quickly to users worldwide.
    *   **Cost-Effectiveness**: A unified Worker-based architecture can be highly cost-effective.
    *   **Simplified DevOps**: CI/CD for the entire application (frontend and backend) is streamlined by deploying to Cloudflare Workers.

## Development Journey & Concept: "Vibe-Coding" with Gemini Canvas

This Global Seismic Activity Monitor was brought to life through a dynamic and iterative development process, affectionately termed "vibe-coding." The project was conceptualized and significantly shaped within Gemini Canvas, leveraging a conversational AI-assisted development workflow.

**How it worked:**

* **Conversational Prototyping**: Initial ideas and feature requirements were discussed with Gemini. Based on these conversations, Gemini generated foundational React components and logic.
* **Iterative Refinement**: Each feature, from basic globe setup to complex interactions like the ring highlights or data-driven UI updates, was built incrementally. The process involved:
    * Describing the desired functionality or behavior.
    * Reviewing and testing the code suggestions provided by Gemini.
    * Identifying issues, bugs, or areas for improvement (like the ring animation or hover states).
    * Providing feedback, error messages, and updated code snippets back to Gemini.
    * Receiving revised code and explanations, and integrating them into the application.
* **Agile & Exploratory**: This "vibe-coding" approach allowed for rapid exploration of different UI/UX ideas and quick pivots when a particular implementation wasn't ideal. For example, the globe hover-to-pause feature went through several iterations to achieve the desired precision.
* **Focus on "Feel"**: Beyond just functional code, there was an emphasis on the "vibe" â€“ ensuring the application felt responsive, informative, and visually engaging. This involved tweaking animations, color schemes, and data presentation based on iterative feedback.
* **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: When bugs or unexpected behaviors arose (like the initial ring animation issues), the debugging process was also collaborative, with Gemini helping to diagnose problems based on error messages and observed behavior.

This method facilitated a quick turnaround from concept to a functional prototype, emphasizing a fluid, responsive, and somewhat experimental path to development. It highlights how AI-assisted tools like Gemini Canvas can augment the creative and technical aspects of software development, allowing for rapid iteration and exploration of ideas.

Beyond the initial conceptualization with Gemini Canvas, this project continues to serve as a dynamic testbed for advanced Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities in a real-world software engineering context. Development, maintenance, and iterative enhancements are frequently driven by AI agents like Jules. This involves regular and rigorous testing of the LLM's ability to understand complex requirements, generate and refactor code, debug issues, and contribute to documentation, as demonstrated by this very update to the README.

This ongoing collaboration aims to push the boundaries of what LLMs can achieve in practical, non-trivial application development, providing valuable insights into their strengths and areas for continued improvement. The Global Seismic Activity Monitor is therefore not just a tool for visualizing earthquakes, but also a living experiment in the evolving landscape of AI-assisted software creation.

The project reflects the spirit of innovation and agile creation championed by **Built By Vibes**.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/builtbyvibes/global-seismic-activity-monitor.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd global-seismic-activity-monitor
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (or `yarn install` if you use Yarn)

4.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    (or `yarn dev`)

5.  **Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173` or similar).**

**Developing Cloudflare Workers:**

The backend Cloudflare Workers (e.g., for the USGS proxy) can be developed and tested locally using the Wrangler CLI. While the primary local development for the frontend is done via `npm run dev` (which uses Vite), you can run a local development server for your Worker functions if you need to test them in isolation or develop new Worker-specific features.

*   Navigate to your functions directory (e.g., `functions/`) or the project root if your `wrangler.toml` is configured for it.
*   Use the command `npx wrangler dev` to start the local server for the Worker.
*   Refer to the [Cloudflare Wrangler documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) for more details on local development and testing of Workers.

Note: For this project, the Vite development server is often sufficient for end-to-end testing, as it proxies requests to the live or a locally-served Worker. Direct Worker development with `wrangler dev` is typically needed for more complex Worker logic or when initially setting up new Worker routes and functionalities.

## Project Structure

The `src/` directory contains the core source code for the application, organized as follows:

-   **`assets/`**: Static assets like images, JSON data files (e.g., `TectonicPlateBoundaries.json`, `ne_110m_coastline.json`).
-   **`components/`**: Core UI components. Most components are directly within this folder.
    -   **`components/earthquakeDetail/`**: Components specifically used within the `EarthquakeDetailView`.
    -   **`components/skeletons/`**: Skeleton loader components used for placeholder UI during data fetching.
-   **`constants/`**: Application-wide constants, primarily in `appConstants.js` (e.g., API URLs, thresholds).
-   **`contexts/`**: React Context providers and custom hooks for global state management (e.g., `EarthquakeDataContext.jsx`, `UIStateContext.jsx`).
-   **`functions/`**: Contains serverless function logic, primarily API handlers and related tests, that are part of the overall Cloudflare Worker's functionality. (e.g., `functions/api/calculate-clusters.js`). Note that the main worker entry point is `src/worker.js` which orchestrates routing to these and other functionalities.
    -   **`functions/api/`**: API route handlers (e.g., for cluster calculations, D1 database interactions).
-   **`features/`**: Currently contains a `.gitkeep` file; intended for feature-specific modules in future development.
-   **`hooks/`**: Currently contains a `.gitkeep` file; intended for custom React hooks.
-   **`pages/`**: Top-level React components representing different application pages/views.
    -   **`pages/learn/`**: Components for specific educational article pages.
    -   **`HomePage.jsx`**: Defines the main application structure and routes (exports the `App` component).
-   **`services/`**: Modules for interacting with external APIs or backend services (e.g., `usgsApiService.js`, `clusterApiService.js`).
-   **`utils/`**: General utility functions used across the application (e.g., `utils.js`, `clusterUtils.js`).
-   **`main.jsx`**: The main entry point for the React application, rendering the root component from `HomePage.jsx`.
-   **`index.css`**: Global styles and Tailwind CSS base configuration.

Additionally, at the project root:

-   **`wrangler.toml`**: The configuration file for Cloudflare Workers projects. It defines build settings, environments, routes, service bindings (like KV, D1, and static assets), cron triggers, and compatibility settings for the Worker.

This structure helps in organizing the codebase logically, making it easier to navigate and maintain. JSDoc comments are used throughout these files to provide detailed documentation for components, functions, and hooks.

## Technical Documentation

JSDoc comments have been added throughout the `.jsx` files in the `src` directory. These comments provide explanations for components, functions, props, and data structures to facilitate understanding and maintenance of the codebase.

### Generating HTML Documentation

You can generate HTML documentation from these JSDoc comments using the `jsdoc` npm package.

1.  **Install JSDoc and a template (e.g., Docdash)**:
    You can install `jsdoc` globally or as a development dependency in your project. `docdash` is a popular clean template.
    ```bash
    # Global installation
    npm install -g jsdoc docdash

    # Or, as dev dependencies
    npm install --save-dev jsdoc docdash
    ```

2.  **Create a JSDoc Configuration File (Optional but Recommended)**:
    Create a `jsdoc.json` (or `conf.json`) file in your project root for better control over the documentation generation process.
    Example `jsdoc.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "source": {
        "include": ["src"],
        "includePattern": ".+\\.jsx?$",
        "excludePattern": "(node_modules|docs)"
      },
      "opts": {
        "destination": "./docs/jsdoc/",
        "recurse": true,
        "readme": "./README.md",
        "template": "node_modules/docdash"
      },
      "plugins": ["plugins/markdown"],
      "templates": {
        "default": {
          "outputSourceFiles": false
        },
        "docdash": {
          "static": true,
          "sort": true,
          "search": true,
          "collapse": true,
          "typedefs": true,
          "removeQuotes": "none",
          "menu": {
            "Github repo": {
              "href": "https://github.com/builtbyvibes/global-seismic-activity-monitor",
              "target": "_blank"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    *Note: If you installed `docdash` locally, the path to the template would be `node_modules/docdash`. If globally, you might need to provide the full path to the global `docdash` template or use a JSDoc plugin to resolve global templates.*

3.  **Run JSDoc**:
    Since `jsdoc` and `docdash` are listed as development dependencies in `package.json`, you can run JSDoc using `npx` after installing dependencies (`npm install`).

    If you are using the `jsdoc.json` configuration file (recommended):
    ```bash
    npx jsdoc -c jsdoc.json
    ```
    Alternatively, you can specify options directly on the command line:
    ```bash
    npx jsdoc src -r -d docs/jsdoc --template node_modules/docdash --readme README.md
    ```
    This will generate the documentation in the `docs/jsdoc/` directory. Open the `index.html` file in that directory to view the documentation.

    **Recommended:** For convenience, consider adding a script to your `package.json`:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      // ... other scripts
      "docs": "jsdoc -c jsdoc.json"
    }
    ```
    Then, you can simply run:
    ```bash
    npm run docs
    ```

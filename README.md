# Global Seismic Activity Monitor

## Description

The Global Seismic Activity Monitor is a React-based web application that visualizes real-time and historical global earthquake data on an interactive 3D globe. It provides detailed statistics, insights into seismic events, and educational information about earthquake science. Users can explore recent and significant earthquakes, view their details, and understand their distribution and magnitude in a geographical context.

## Features

* Interactive 3D Globe: Visualizes earthquake epicenters on a zoomable, rotatable globe.
* Real-time & Historical Data: Fetches and displays earthquake data from USGS for various periods (last hour, day, week, month).
* Geographical Layers: Shows tectonic plate boundaries and coastlines for geological context.
* Latest Major Quake Highlight: Animates a pulsing yellow ring on the globe to pinpoint the most recent significant earthquake (M4.5+).
* Detailed Earthquake View: Modal display providing comprehensive information for selected earthquakes, including magnitude, depth, location, fault plane solutions, and ShakeMap/PAGER alerts when available.
    * **2D Regional Map**: Within the detail view, a 2D map displays the earthquake's epicenter, ShakeMap intensity image (if available), and tectonic plate boundaries for regional context.
* Smart Globe Rotation: Globe auto-rotates and intelligently pauses when the user hovers over the sphere, resuming on mouse-out.
* Dynamic Statistics & Charts:
    * Overview panel with key statistics for the last 24 hours.
    * Summaries for different timeframes (last hour, 24h, 7-day, 14-day, 30-day).

## Development Journey & Concept: "Vibe-Coding" with Gemini Canvas

This Global Seismic Activity Monitor was brought to life through a dynamic and iterative development process, affectionately termed "vibe-coding." The project was conceptualized and significantly shaped within Gemini Canvas, leveraging a conversational AI-assisted development workflow.

**How it worked:**

* **Conversational Prototyping**: Initial ideas and feature requirements were discussed with Gemini. Based on these conversations, Gemini generated foundational React components and logic.
* **Iterative Refinement**: Each feature, from basic globe setup to complex interactions like the ring highlights or data-driven UI updates, was built incrementally. The process involved:
    * Describing the desired functionality or behavior.
    * Reviewing and testing the code suggestions provided by Gemini.
    * Identifying issues, bugs, or areas for improvement (like the ring animation or hover states).
    * Providing feedback, error messages, and updated code snippets back to Gemini.
    * Receiving revised code and explanations, and integrating them into the application.
* **Agile & Exploratory**: This "vibe-coding" approach allowed for rapid exploration of different UI/UX ideas and quick pivots when a particular implementation wasn't ideal. For example, the globe hover-to-pause feature went through several iterations to achieve the desired precision.
* **Focus on "Feel"**: Beyond just functional code, there was an emphasis on the "vibe" â€“ ensuring the application felt responsive, informative, and visually engaging. This involved tweaking animations, color schemes, and data presentation based on iterative feedback.
* **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: When bugs or unexpected behaviors arose (like the initial ring animation issues), the debugging process was also collaborative, with Gemini helping to diagnose problems based on error messages and observed behavior.

This method facilitated a quick turnaround from concept to a functional prototype, emphasizing a fluid, responsive, and somewhat experimental path to development. It highlights how AI-assisted tools like Gemini Canvas can augment the creative and technical aspects of software development, allowing for rapid iteration and exploration of ideas.

The project reflects the spirit of innovation and agile creation championed by **Built By Vibes**.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd <project-name>
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (or `yarn install` if you use Yarn)

4.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    (or `yarn dev`)

5.  Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173` or similar).

## Project Structure

The `src/` directory contains the core source code for the application, organized as follows:

-   **`assets/`**: Static assets like images, JSON data files (e.g., tectonic plate boundaries, coastline data), and other resources.
-   **`components/`**: Reusable React components that make up the user interface. Each component is typically in its own `.jsx` file.
-   **`constants/`**: Contains constant values used throughout the application, such as API endpoints, thresholds, or configuration settings (e.g., `appConstants.js`).
-   **`features/`**: Might contain modules or components related to specific application features. (Note: This directory was present in the `ls` output but empty, so its purpose is inferred. If it's unused, it could be omitted or its intended purpose clarified).
-   **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable stateful logic (e.g., `useEarthquakeData.js`).
-   **`pages/`**: Top-level React components that represent different "pages" or views of the application (e.g., `HomePage.jsx`).
-   **`utils/`**: Utility functions that provide helper functionalities used across different parts of the application (e.g., date formatting, calculations in `utils.js`).
-   **`App.jsx`**: The root application component.
-   **`main.jsx`**: The main entry point for the React application.
-   **`index.css`**: Global styles for the application.

This structure helps in organizing the codebase logically, making it easier to navigate and maintain. JSDoc comments are used throughout these files to provide detailed documentation for components, functions, and hooks.

## Technical Documentation

JSDoc comments have been added throughout the `.jsx` files in the `src` directory. These comments provide explanations for components, functions, props, and data structures to facilitate understanding and maintenance of the codebase.

### Generating HTML Documentation

You can generate HTML documentation from these JSDoc comments using the `jsdoc` npm package.

1.  **Install JSDoc and a template (e.g., Docdash)**:
    You can install `jsdoc` globally or as a development dependency in your project. `docdash` is a popular clean template.
    ```bash
    # Global installation
    npm install -g jsdoc docdash

    # Or, as dev dependencies
    npm install --save-dev jsdoc docdash
    ```

2.  **Create a JSDoc Configuration File (Optional but Recommended)**:
    Create a `jsdoc.json` (or `conf.json`) file in your project root for better control over the documentation generation process.
    Example `jsdoc.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "source": {
        "include": ["src"],
        "includePattern": ".+\\.jsx?$",
        "excludePattern": "(node_modules|docs)"
      },
      "opts": {
        "destination": "./docs/jsdoc/",
        "recurse": true,
        "readme": "./README.md",
        "template": "node_modules/docdash"
      },
      "plugins": ["plugins/markdown"],
      "templates": {
        "default": {
          "outputSourceFiles": false
        },
        "docdash": {
          "static": true,
          "sort": true,
          "search": true,
          "collapse": true,
          "typedefs": true,
          "removeQuotes": "none",
          "menu": {
            "Github repo": {
              "href": "https://github.com/your-repo/your-project",
              "target": "_blank"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    *Note: If you installed `docdash` locally, the path to the template would be `node_modules/docdash`. If globally, you might need to provide the full path to the global `docdash` template or use a JSDoc plugin to resolve global templates.*

3.  **Run JSDoc**:
    If you are using a configuration file:
    ```bash
    jsdoc -c jsdoc.json
    ```
    Alternatively, you can specify options directly on the command line:
    ```bash
    jsdoc src -r -d docs/jsdoc --template node_modules/docdash --readme README.md
    ```
    This will generate the documentation in the `docs/jsdoc/` directory. Open the `index.html` file in that directory to view the documentation.

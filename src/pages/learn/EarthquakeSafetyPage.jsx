            Earthquakes can strike without warning, making preparation and knowledge essential for your safety.
            Knowing what to do before, during, and after an earthquake can significantly reduce the risk of injury
            and property damage. Here are some fundamental safety tips.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-400 pt-2">Before an Earthquake: Be Prepared</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Secure Your Space:</strong> Fasten shelves securely to walls. Place large or heavy objects
              on lower shelves. Secure heavy furniture like bookcases and refrigerators to the walls.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Create a Plan:</strong> Identify safe spots in each room (under a sturdy table or desk).
              Establish a meeting point for your family if you get separated.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Emergency Kit:</strong> Assemble an emergency kit that includes water, non-perishable food,
              a flashlight, a first-aid kit, a whistle to signal for help, and any necessary medications.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Know Your Home:</strong> Learn how to turn off the main gas, water, and electricity valves in your home.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-400 pt-2">During an Earthquake: Drop, Cover, and Hold On</h2>
          <p>
            This simple yet effective technique is your best defense during an earthquake.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>DROP</strong> to your hands and knees. This position prevents you from being knocked down
              and allows you to crawl to shelter.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>COVER</strong> your head and neck with one arm and hand. If a sturdy table or desk is nearby,
              crawl beneath it for shelter. If not, crawl next to an interior wall (away from windows).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>HOLD ON</strong> to your shelter (or your head and neck) until the shaking stops. Be prepared
              to move with your shelter if the shaking shifts it around.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you are outdoors, stay there and move away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires.
            If you are in a vehicle, stop as quickly as safety permits and stay in the vehicle. Avoid stopping
            near or under buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-400 pt-2">After an Earthquake: Stay Safe</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Check for Injuries:</strong> Check yourself and others for injuries. Provide first aid for
              anyone who needs it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Check for Hazards:</strong> Look for and extinguish small fires. Check for gas leaksâ€”if you
              smell gas or hear a blowing or hissing noise, open a window and leave the building. Turn off the
              gas at the outside main valve if you can and call the gas company from a safe location.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Expect Aftershocks:</strong> These are smaller earthquakes that can occur in the hours, days,
              or even weeks after the main event. Be prepared to Drop, Cover, and Hold On again.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Use a battery-operated radio or your phone to listen for emergency
              updates and instructions from local authorities.
            </li>
